Apart from the temple, the city had palaces with mandapas or platforms, from where the king held the courts and issued orders. There were barracks for the army stationed near the palace. Another major feature of this town was the market. It was filled with traders selling food grains like wheat and millet. Spices, Jewellery and Clothes were the major items in the market. Thanjavur played a crucial role in influencing the economy of nearby villages and towns. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and Uraiyur produced fine cotton clothes for the king and nobles and also for the public. Weavers also produce clothes to make flags for ceremonies in the temple.'"
